## Next Steps

1. Finalize MVP feature list (what ships in v1.0)
2. Decide on platform (Android-first? Cross-platform?)
3. Choose tech stack (Native Kotlin? Flutter? React Native?)

## Session Log

### 2026-01-04: Initial Setup

**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Focus:** Brainstorming and knowledge system setup

**What was discussed:**
- App vision and market positioning
- Competitive landscape (Fitbod, JEFIT, Alpha Progression, Lyfta, etc. vs Fitnotes)
- Target user personas (Veteran, Intermediate, Beginner)
- Monetization philosophy (free core + optional supporter purchase)
- Authentication approach (local-first, optional cloud)
- Feature ideas for disruption

**Decisions made:**
- Veteran-first design approach
- Free or very cheap pricing ($0-5, not subscription)
- Local-first architecture
- "Just Let Me Lift" vs "Help Me Start" mode concept

**What was created:**
- AGENTS.md (knowledge persistence instructions)
- Knowledge files: app-vision, target-users, competitive-analysis, monetization
- Workflow files: code-review, create-workflow
- This progress document
