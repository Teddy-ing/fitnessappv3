# Monetization Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**Goal:** Make money optional, not required for core value.

This app exists to disrupt, not to maximize revenue. Monetization should:
- Never feel like a gate or punishment
- Make users WANT to pay, not feel forced
- Support development, not extract maximum value
- Align with indie/community ethos

## Pricing Models Considered

| Model | Pros | Cons | Fit |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| **Completely Free** | Max adoption, goodwill, word-of-mouth | No revenue, sustainability concerns | ⭐ Possible |
| **One-Time Purchase ($3-5)** | Users prefer this, no recurring anxiety | Less revenue over time | ⭐⭐ Strong fit |
| **Freemium (Core free + Premium)** | Accessible entry, revenue from power users | Requires careful feature gating | ⭐⭐ Strong fit |
| **Free + Tip Jar** | Zero friction, community-supported | Unpredictable, low conversion | ⭐ Possible |
| **Subscription ($10+/mo)** | Recurring revenue, industry standard | Against our positioning, user resentment | ❌ Rejected |
| **Ads** | Revenue without direct payment | Degrades experience, feels cheap | ❌ Rejected |

## Anti-Friction Principles

### DO:
- ✅ Let users experience the full app before any purchase prompt
- ✅ Make upgrade feel like "supporting an indie dev"
- ✅ Be explicit: "This helps keep the app free for everyone"
- ✅ Offer purchasing after user has logged X workouts (earned trust)
- ✅ Keep upgrade prompt dismissible and non-recurring

### DON'T:
- ❌ Lock core logging features
- ❌ Add artificial limitations (e.g., "3 workouts/month free")
- ❌ Nag users repeatedly about upgrading
- ❌ Use dark patterns or guilt-tripping
- ❌ Make free tier feel like a demo
- ❌ Ever show ads

---

## Upgrade Prompt Timing

Only show upgrade prompt after:
1. User has logged at least 5 workouts (they're committed)
2. User has been using app for 2+ weeks
3. User attempts to use a premium feature

When shown:
- Single dismissible modal
- Clear explanation of what they get
- "No thanks, I'm good with free" is prominent
- Never shown again for 30+ days if dismissed

---

## Financial Expectations

This is a disruption play, not a business:
- Expected revenue: $0 - low thousands/month
- This is fine and intentional
- Sustainability through low overhead (solo/small team)
- If it takes off, revisit—but don't optimize for this
