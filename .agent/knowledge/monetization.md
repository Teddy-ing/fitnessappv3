# Monetization Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**Goal:** Make money optional, not required for core value.

This app exists to disrupt, not to maximize revenue. Monetization should:
- Never feel like a gate or punishment
- Make users WANT to pay, not feel forced
- Support development, not extract maximum value
- Align with indie/community ethos

## Pricing Models Considered

| Model | Pros | Cons | Fit |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| **Completely Free + Donations** | Max adoption, goodwill, indie ethos | Unpredictable income | ⭐⭐ **Chosen** |
| **Free + Paid AI Tier** | Covers API costs, fair value exchange | Requires careful pricing | ⭐⭐ **Chosen** |
| **One-Time Purchase** | Users prefer this | Doesn't cover ongoing AI costs | Partially fits |
| **Subscription ($10+/mo)** | Recurring revenue | Against our positioning | ❌ Rejected |
| **Ads** | Revenue without payment | Degrades experience | ❌ Rejected |

## Chosen Approach

**Free Core + Donations + Optional Cheap AI Subscription**

### Free Tier (Fully Featured)
Everything needed for a complete workout tracking experience:
- ✅ Unlimited workout logging
- ✅ Unlimited templates
- ✅ Full exercise database
- ✅ Rest timer
- ✅ Full analytics and progress tracking
- ✅ **On-device ML features** (autocomplete, workout suggestions)
- ✅ Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- ✅ Import from competitors
- ✅ Google Cloud / iCloud backup (optional)

### AI Tier (Cheap Subscription)
Cloud-based AI features that cost money to run:
- 🤖 AI chatbot assistant
- 🤖 Preformatted queries: "Detect weak points", "Give me optimizations"
- 🤖 AI-generated workout templates
- 🤖 Personalized training plans

**Pricing Philosophy for AI Tier:**
- Use lower-end model to minimize costs
- Price slightly above average user's API cost
- Goal: Break even or small margin, not profit maximization
- Possible: $1-3/month or pay-per-use credits

### Donations
- Optional "Buy me a coffee" style donations
- No features gated behind donations
- Purely goodwill-based

## Anti-Friction Principles

### DO:
- ✅ Let users experience the full app before any purchase prompt
- ✅ Make upgrade feel like "supporting an indie dev"
- ✅ Be explicit: "This helps keep the app free for everyone"
- ✅ Offer purchasing after user has logged X workouts (earned trust)
- ✅ Keep upgrade prompt dismissible and non-recurring

### DON'T:
- ❌ Lock core logging features
- ❌ Add artificial limitations (e.g., "3 workouts/month free")
- ❌ Nag users repeatedly about upgrading
- ❌ Use dark patterns or guilt-tripping
- ❌ Make free tier feel like a demo
- ❌ Ever show ads

---

## Upgrade Prompt Timing

Only show upgrade prompt after:
1. User has logged at least 5 workouts (they're committed)
2. User has been using app for 2+ weeks
3. User attempts to use a premium feature

When shown:
- Single dismissible modal
- Clear explanation of what they get
- "No thanks, I'm good with free" is prominent
- Never shown again for 30+ days if dismissed

---

## Financial Expectations

This is a disruption play, not a business:
- Expected revenue: $0 - low thousands/month
- This is fine and intentional
- Sustainability through low overhead (solo/small team)
- If it takes off, revisit—but don't optimize for this
