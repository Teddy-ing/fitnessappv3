# App Vision

## Mission Statement

Create the best weight training app that disrupts the fitness app market by combining:
- The **depth and customization** of Fitnotes (free, powerful, veteran-loved)
- The **modern design and UX** of premium apps (Fitbod, Alpha Progression, etc.)
- An **accessible price point** ($1-5 or free) that removes financial barriers

## Market Positioning

### The Problem
- Premium apps (Fitbod, JEFIT, Alpha Progression, Lyfta, etc.) cost $10+/month
- They add friction with forced onboarding, AI recommendations, "expert" claims
- Fitnotes is free and powerful but has outdated UI
- No app currently bridges this gap

### Our Position
**"Premium quality, indie pricing, veteran-first design"**

We are NOT trying to:
- Maximize revenue
- Be everything to everyone
- Lock users into subscriptions

We ARE trying to:
- Be the app gym veterans recommend
- Respect users' time and intelligence
- Make money optional, not required for core value
- Build trust through transparency and data ownership

## Unique Value Proposition

### "An App That Becomes Yours"

> **The more you use it, the more it adapts to you—while staying 100% private.**

This is our key differentiator against Hevy and others:

| Feature | Hevy | Our App |
|---------|------|----------|
| Auto-fill last workout values | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Smart rep suggestions** based on weight/history | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Workout day prediction** ("Monday = chest day") | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **On-device ML** (never sends data to cloud) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Privacy-first by design | Partial | ✅ Yes |

**Why this matters:**
- Hevy only recalls your *last* values—not smart patterns
- Users on Reddit are *requesting* ML-based progression suggestions
- "Free app that learns YOU and stays private" is a powerful pitch

### Open Source Advantage

This project is **open source**, which means:
- Full transparency about what the app does
- Community can verify privacy claims
- Community contributions and trust
- Aligns with "not about the money" ethos

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Speed Over Everything**
   - Logging a set should take <3 seconds
   - No modals blocking input
   - No animations that slow interaction
   - Smart defaults that learn

2. **Respect User Intelligence**
   - No forced tutorials
   - No "AI knows best" overrides
   - Optional guidance, never mandatory
   - Users control their experience

3. **Data Belongs to Users**
   - Local-first architecture
   - Export everything, always
   - Import from competitors
   - Cloud sync optional, not required

4. **Transparency Over Dark Patterns**
   - No artificial limitations to force upgrades
   - Clear about what's free vs paid
   - No guilt-tripping or manipulation
   - Honest about capabilities

## Scope

### In Scope
- Weight training / resistance exercise tracking
- Progressive overload tracking
- Workout templates and routines
- Analytics and progress visualization
- Rest timers
- Exercise database

### Out of Scope (for now)
- Nutrition / calorie tracking
- Cardio-focused features
- Social/community features
- AI-generated workout plans
- Wearable integrations
