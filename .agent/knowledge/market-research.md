## Stretching & Mobility: A Separate Market

**Key Finding:** No weight training app does stretching/mobility well. Users use separate apps:

| App | Focus | Price |
|-----|-------|-------|
| **Pliability** (ROMWOD) | Athlete mobility, 15-20min sessions | Subscription |
| **Bend** | General flexibility, beginner-friendly | Free + Paid |
| **StretchIt** | Flexibility-focused, progress tracking | Subscription |
| **GOWOD** | CrossFit mobility | Subscription |

**Opportunity:** Integrating warmup/stretching into a weight training app is a genuine differentiator.

# Reddit User Sentiment Analysis

## What Serious Lifters Complain About

### 3. Paywall Frustration

- Free tiers that are unusable
- Core features (templates, analytics) locked
- Nagging about premium constantly

- Active development = trust

### 5. Data Lock-In

- Switching between apps is painful
- Export/import rarely seamless
- Users want full data ownership
